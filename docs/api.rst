Making Requests
===============

The :py:mod:`treq` module provides several shortcut functions for making
requests.  These functions all create a default 
:py:class:`treq.client.HTTPClient` instance and pass their arguments to
the appropriate :py:class:`~treq.client.HTTPClient` method.

.. module:: treq

.. autofunction:: request
.. autofunction:: get
.. autofunction:: head
.. autofunction:: post
.. autofunction:: put
.. autofunction:: patch
.. autofunction:: delete

Accessing Content
=================

.. autofunction:: collect
.. autofunction:: content
.. autofunction:: text_content
.. autofunction:: json_content

The HTTP Client
===============

.. module:: treq.client

.. class:: HTTPClient(agent, cookiejar=None, data_to_body_producer=IBodyProducer)

:py:class:`~treq.client.HTTPClient` has methods that match the signatures of the
shortcut request functions in the :py:mod:`treq` module.

Responses
=========

.. module:: treq.response

.. class:: Response

    .. method:: collect(collector)

        Incrementally collect the body of the response.

        :param collector: A single argument callable that will be called
            with chunks of body data as it is received.

        :returns: A `Deferred` that fires when the entire body has been
            received.

    .. method:: content()

        Read the entire body all at once.

        :returns: A `Deferred` that fires with a `bytes` object when the entire
            body has been received.

    .. method:: text(encoding='ISO-8859-1')

        Read the entire body all at once as text.
        :param encoding: An encoding for the body, if none is given the
            encoding will be guessed, defaulting to this argument.

        :returns: A `Deferred` that fires with a `unicode` object when the
            entire body has been received.

    .. method:: json()

        Read the entire body all at once and decode it as JSON.

        :returns: A `Deferred` that fires with the result of `json.loads` on
            the body after it has been received.

    .. method:: history()

        Get a list of all responses that (such as intermediate redirects),
        that ultimately ended in the current response.

        :returns: A `list` of :class:`treq.response.Response` objects.

    .. method:: cookies()

        :returns: A `CookieJar`.

    Inherited from twisted.web.iweb.IResponse.
