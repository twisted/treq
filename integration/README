Treq Integration
----------------

These are integraton tests that test treq against webzoo:

http://github.com/klizhentas/webzoo

Installation
------------
* Install webzoo and launch images with frameworks you'd wish to test against.
* Install treq and everything needed for it

Usage
-----
> python run.py

What happens:

* run.py will inspect current running images of webzoo and their port mappings.
* later it will execute tests in file test_treq.py using trial against
 every image, providing TREQ_PORT to file test_treq.py
